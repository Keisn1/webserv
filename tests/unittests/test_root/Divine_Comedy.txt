Just so was I on seeing this new vision
I wanted to see how our image fuses
Into the circle and finds its place in it,
 
Yet my wings were not meant for such a flight â€”
Except that then my mind was struck by lightning
Through which my longing was at last fulfilled.
 
Here powers failed my high imagination:
But by now my desire and will were turned,
Like a balanced wheel rotated evenly,
 
By the Love that moves the sun and the other stars.
