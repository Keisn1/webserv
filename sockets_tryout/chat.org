*** We need to understand how =poll= works. We have one file descriptor =server_fd= that we get from creating a socket. We know how the socket commands work (listen, bind, accept). Give us a small introduction first

Sure! The =poll= system call is used for multiplexing input/output over multiple file descriptors. It waits for one or more file descriptors to become "ready" for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input is possible).

Here's a brief overview:

1. *Purpose*: =poll= allows a program to monitor multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of them, without blocking on a single one.

2. *File Descriptors*: These represent various resources like sockets, files, or pipes. In your case, =server_fd= is a socket file descriptor.

3. *Usage in Networking*: After setting up a server socket with =listen=, you might want to manage multiple connections. =poll= can help you determine when the server socket has incoming connections or when existing connections have data ready to read.

*** Basic Steps:

1. *Include Headers*: To use =poll=, you need to include the necessary headers:
   #+begin_src c
   #include <poll.h>
   #include <sys/socket.h>
   #+end_src

2. *Initialize =pollfd= Structures*: You need an array of =struct pollfd= to specify which file descriptors you want to monitor and the events you're interested in. Here's an example initialization:
   #+begin_src c
   struct pollfd fds[1];
   fds[0].fd = server_fd;
   fds[0].events = POLLIN; // Monitor for input (e.g., incoming connections)
   #+end_src

3. *Call =poll=*: Use =poll= to wait for events on the monitored file descriptors:
   #+begin_src c
   int timeout = 10000; // Wait for up to 10 seconds
   int ret = poll(fds, 1, timeout);
   #+end_src

4. *Check =poll= Result*: After the call to =poll=, check its return value:
   - =ret > 0=: One or more file descriptors are ready.
   - =ret == 0=: Timeout occurred, no file descriptor is ready.
   - =ret < 0=: An error occurred.

5. *Handle Events*: If a file descriptor is ready, inspect the =revents= field to determine which events occurred:
   #+begin_src c
   if (fds[0].revents & POLLIN) {
       // Handle incoming connection or data
   }
   #+end_src

=poll= is particularly useful for managing multiple connections at once, especially in server applications where you don't want to block on a single client.

*** Ok. I don't see "accept" anymore. It is not used right?

Actually, =accept= is still very much used. In the context of a server using =poll=, =accept= is used when the server socket (=server_fd=) is ready to accept a new connection. Here's how it fits into the flow:

1. *Setup*: Create and bind a server socket using =socket=, =bind=, and =listen=.

2. *Poll for Incoming Connections*:
   - Use =poll= to monitor the server socket (=server_fd=) for incoming connection requests. You'll set the =POLLIN= event on the socket to check if there is a connection waiting to be accepted.

3. *Handle Readiness*:
   - When =poll= indicates that the server socket is ready (i.e., =POLLIN= is set in =revents=), it means there is an incoming connection.

4. *Accept the Connection*:
   - Use =accept= on =server_fd= to accept the incoming connection. This returns a new file descriptor for the connection which can then be used for communication with the client.

5. *Manage Client Connections*:
   - You can then add this new client file descriptor to your array of =pollfd= structures to monitor it for future events (e.g., incoming data).

So, =accept= is used whenever a new connection is accepted, even if the decision to accept was guided by the results from =poll=.

*** so why would i need poll, if I only have one file_descriptor to monitor? I only listen on one port (HTTP Server).

If you're working with a simple HTTP server that only needs to handle one incoming connection at a time, and one file descriptor (the listening socket), you might not need =poll= initially. You could use a simple loop with blocking calls like =accept= to handle connections sequentially.

However, =poll= becomes useful when:

1. *Handling Multiple Connections*: If your server evolves to manage multiple client connections at once, =poll= lets you monitor multiple file descriptors (e.g., many client sockets) simultaneously, allowing you to handle multiple active connections within the same process.

2. *Non-blocking Operations*: Even with one listening socket, using =poll= (or similar mechanisms like =select= or =epoll=) enables non-blocking behavior. You can set timeouts and do other processing before or after handling connections.

3. *Scaling and Responsiveness*: With =poll=, you can be more flexible and efficient, particularly under load. For instance, it allows you to service numerous connections without dedicating a thread or process to each one, which is useful for scaling out your application.

In summary, while you might not need =poll= for a single-threaded, blocking setup with one connection at a time, it provides significant benefits for handling multiple concurrent connections efficiently and scaling your server.

*** how do i get multiple client connections on the same port?

To handle multiple client connections on the same port, you should:

1. *Set Up the Server*:
   - Create a socket and bind it to the desired port.
   - Set the socket to listen for incoming connections using the =listen= function. This prepares the socket to accept connections.

2. *Accept Connections*:
   - Use =accept= to accept an incoming connection. This creates a new socket specifically for the connected client and allows the server to continue listening for new connection requests on the original listening socket.

3. *Utilize =poll=/=select=/=epoll=*:
   - Use a multiplexing call like =poll= (or =select= or =epoll=) to monitor both the listening socket and all active client sockets. This allows you to handle input/output operations with multiple clients asynchronously within a single thread or process.

4. *Handle Client I/O*:
   - When =poll= or a similar call indicates that the listening socket is ready for reading, use =accept= to handle the new incoming connection, and add the new client socket to your set of monitored file descriptors.
   - For existing client sockets, check if they are ready for reading/writing and handle them accordingly.

By following this pattern, your server can handle multiple connections from different clients on the same port concurrently, since each call to =accept= can create a new socket for a different client connection. This allows you to maintain communication with all connected clients while still accepting new ones.

*** so what i have in mind now is the following (PseudoCode):
#+begin_src cpp
struct pollfd *pfds = NULL;
int nfds = 0;

while (true) {
	new_socket = accept(_server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&_address, &_addrlen);

	// TODO: configure new struct pollfd
	// i.e. pfds.events = POLLIN;

    // TODO: add new pollfd to pfds
	nfds++;

	// call poll again with updated pfds
	int ready = poll(pfds, nfds, 100);
	if (ready == -1)
		errExit("poll");

	// treat event
	// i.e. new messages being sent; new messages being sent back
}
#+end_src



Your pseudocode is on the right track for handling multiple client connections using =poll=. However, there are a few details to consider for implementing this effectively:

1. *Dynamic Array Management*: Since the number of connections (and thus =struct pollfd= entries) can change, you'll need a way to dynamically manage the array of =pollfd= structures (e.g., using realloc).

2. *Initialize New Struct =pollfd=*: For each new socket returned by =accept=, you'll need to configure a new =struct pollfd= with the socket descriptor and the events you're interested in (such as =POLLIN= for readable data).

3. *Monitor the Listening Socket*: Ensure that your original listening socket (_server_fd) is also being monitored by =poll= for new connection requests.

Here's how you might expand your pseudocode:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <vector> // For dynamic management of pollfd

std::vector<struct pollfd> pfds;
pfds.push_back({ _server_fd, POLLIN, 0 }); // Initial file descriptor setup to listen for new connections

while (true) {
    int ready = poll(pfds.data(), pfds.size(), 100);

    if (ready == -1)
        errExit("poll");

    for (size_t i = 0; i < pfds.size(); i++) {
        if (pfds[i].revents & POLLIN) {
            if (pfds[i].fd == _server_fd) {
                // Ready to accept a new connection
                int new_socket = accept(_server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&_address, &_addrlen);

                if (new_socket == -1)
                    errExit("accept");

                struct pollfd new_pfd = { new_socket, POLLIN, 0 };
                pfds.push_back(new_pfd);
            } else {
                // For example, receive data or send a response.
				// read from pfds[i]
				// parse HTTP
				// MapToResources
				// Retriever or CGI (multi-processes/ forking)
				// Generate Response
                // Write to pfds[i]
            }
        }
    }

    // Optionally, manage pfds (remove closed connections)
}
#+end_src

Several key points:
- *Dynamic Array*: Using a =std::vector= to manage an array of =pollfd= structures. This handles resizing and memory management automatically.
- *Listening Socket*: The original listening socket (_server_fd) is included in the vector and monitored for new connections.
- *Handling Connections*: When =poll= indicates that _server_fd is ready, you accept the new connection and add it to the list. You also check each client socket for readable data.

*** I've updated your code with some more pseudoCode. I'm wondering how I can send data back to the filedescriptor (send back to the socket) and check with poll that it is being ready to be written to

#+begin_src cpp
#include <vector> // For dynamic management of pollfd

std::vector<struct pollfd> pfds;
pfds.push_back({ _server_fd, POLLIN, 0 }); // Initial file descriptor setup to listen for new connections

while (true) {
    int ready = poll(pfds.data(), pfds.size(), 100);

    if (ready == -1)
        errExit("poll");

    for (size_t i = 0; i < pfds.size(); i++) {
        if (pfds[i].revents & POLLIN) {
            if (pfds[i].fd == _server_fd) {
                // Ready to accept a new connection
                int new_socket = accept(_server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&_address, &_addrlen);

                if (new_socket == -1)
                    errExit("accept");

                struct pollfd new_pfd = { new_socket, POLLIN, 0 };
                pfds.push_back(new_pfd);
            } else {
				read(new_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);
                // For example, receive data or send a response.
				// read from pfds[i]
				// parse HTTP
				// MapToResources
				// Retriever or CGI (multi-processes/ forking)
				// Generate Response
            }
        }
        if (pfds[i].revents & POLLOUT) {
			// write Response
			send(pfds[i].fd, msg.str().c_str(), msg.str().size(), 0);
			// close pdfs[i]
			// remove from pfds
		}
    }

    // Optionally, manage pfds (remove closed connections)
}

Your pseudocode is shaping up well for an HTTP server using =poll=. Here's how you can handle sending data back to a file descriptor and checking when it's ready for writing:

1. *Monitor Both Reading and Writing*: Modify the monitored events for each client socket to include both =POLLIN= and =POLLOUT=. Initially, you might only want to monitor =POLLIN=, and then dynamically update this to include =POLLOUT= when you have data ready to send.

2. *Send Data*: When =poll= indicates that a socket is ready for writing (=POLLOUT=), you can use the =send= function to send data.

3. *Modify Events*: After sending all the data, you might want to stop monitoring =POLLOUT= until there's more data to send.

Here's how you might update your pseudocode:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <vector> // For dynamic management of pollfd

std::vector<struct pollfd> pfds;
pfds.push_back({ _server_fd, POLLIN, 0 }); // Initial file descriptor setup to listen for new connections

while (true) {
    int ready = poll(pfds.data(), pfds.size(), 100);

    if (ready == -1)
        errExit("poll");

    for (size_t i = 0; i < pfds.size(); i++) {
        if (pfds[i].revents & POLLIN) {
            if (pfds[i].fd == _server_fd) {
                // Ready to accept a new connection
                int new_socket = accept(_server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&_address, &_addrlen);

                if (new_socket == -1)
                    errExit("accept");

                struct pollfd new_pfd = { new_socket, POLLIN, 0 };
                pfds.push_back(new_pfd);
            } else {
                char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
                ssize_t bytes_read = read(pfds[i].fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
                if (bytes_read > 0) {
                    // Process data, prepare response
                    // Here you would parse HTTP, determine response, etc.

                    // Example: Mark socket to watch for writing
                    pfds[i].events |= POLLOUT; // Add POLLOUT to event flags
                } else {
                    // Handle disconnection
                    close(pfds[i].fd);
                    pfds.erase(pfds.begin() + i);
                    i--; // Adjust loop index after removal
                }
            }
        }

        if (pfds[i].revents & POLLOUT) {
            const char* response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 13\r\n\r\nHello, world!";
            ssize_t bytes_sent = send(pfds[i].fd, response, strlen(response), 0);

            if (bytes_sent > 0) {
                // Remove POLLOUT event after sending response
                pfds[i].events &= ~POLLOUT;

                // Optionally close and remove socket if done
                close(pfds[i].fd);
                pfds.erase(pfds.begin() + i);
                i--; // Adjust loop index after removal
            }
        }
    }

    // Optionally, manage pfds (remove closed connections)
}
#+end_src

*** Key Points:
- *Dynamic Event Modification*: You can modify the =events= field of =struct pollfd= dynamically to include =POLLOUT= when you're ready to send data.
- *Remove POLLOUT When Done*: After sending data, clear the =POLLOUT= bit when you no longer need to write.
- *Connection Management*: Make sure to close connections when you're done to avoid resource leaks, and adjust your loop to not skip entries after modifying your list.
