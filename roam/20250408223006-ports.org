#+startup: overview

- a network device has a certain amount of channels that it can open and through which data can be transmitted
- the network device usually get's assigned an ip-address and all of these channels correspond to the same ip-address
- these channels are numbered and usually go up to the 2**16=65536 (2**8=1024)
- if another device want to transfer data it needs to indicate a certain channel number
  - but since this can become tedious, a standard of usage of channel numbers has been established
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers#Well-known_ports][List of TCP and UDP port numbers]]
  - so certain protocols are assigned for certain channels
- these channels are called ports
