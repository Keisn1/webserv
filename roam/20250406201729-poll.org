#+title: poll
#+date: [2025-04-06 Sun 20:17]
#+startup: overview

- is a C standard library function
  - waits for a set of file descriptors to become ready to perform I/O
  - epoll has more features
  - I imagine it to useful, to listen to ports

#+begin_src c
int poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout);
#+end_src

- it takes an array to the =struct pollfd=
  - nfds represents the number of file descriptors inside fds

#+begin_src c
struct pollfd {
    int fd;             /* file desciptor */
    short events;       /* requested events */
    short revents;      /* returned events */
};
#+end_src
- fd is an *open* file-descriptor

* Bitmasks
- *POLLIN* ... Alert me when data is ready to be recv()ed
- *POLLOUT* ... Alert me when the I can send() data to this socket
- *POLLHUP* ... Alert me when the client hung up, the remote connection was closed
