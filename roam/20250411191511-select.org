#+title: select
#+date: [2025-04-11 Fri 19:15]
#+startup: overview

* general
- allows resources to be used more efficiently on the thread that it is runnning on
- watches connections until they become ready for reading/writing
- only pitfall for select is that it can only monitor only filedescriptors up to FD_SETSIZE
  #+begin_src cpp
int select(int nfds, fd_set *_Nullable restrict readfds, // checking for reading
		   fd_set *_Nullable restrict writefds,	 // checking for errors
		   fd_set *_Nullable restrict exceptfds, // checking for errors/exceptions
		   struct timeval *_Nullable restrict timeout);
  #+end_src
- is destructrive, which means that the content of the fd_sets are going to be changed by select
- works with Macros
  #+begin_src cpp
FD_SET(server_socket, &current_sockets);
FD_SET(client_socket, &current_sockets);
// ##############################
handle_conntection(i);			// i is the filedescriptors
FD_CLR(i, &current_sockets);
  #+end_src

* Examples
** only reading
#+begin_src cpp
select(FD_SETSIZE, &ready_sockets, NULL, NULL, NULL)
#+end_src
