#+begin_src c
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
#+end_src
* domain
- address family
- is the protocol family that is used for the communication
- describes which category of address the socket can communicat with
  - therefore it is belonging to a bounded space, hence domain
- AF ... refers to address family
#+begin_example
AF_INET      IPv4 Internet protocols                    ip(7)
AF_UNIX      Local communication                        unix(7)
AF_INET6     IPv6 Internet protocols                    ipv6(7)
#+end_example
* type
- refers to the network layer protocol being used for the communication
- it specifies the language that the socket is speaking (communication semantics)
#+begin_example
SOCK_STREAM     Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based
                byte  streams.  An out-of-band data transmission mecha‚Äê
                nism may be supported.

SOCK_DGRAM      Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages
                of a fixed maximum length).
