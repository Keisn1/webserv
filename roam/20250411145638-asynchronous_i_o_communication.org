#+title: Asynchronous I/O communication
#+date: [2025-04-11 Fri 14:56]
#+startup: overview

* synchronous / blonking approach
- current procedure is stopped until the work is complete

* Problems with only one connection at a time
- it is slow
- it is dependent on that connection to be stable
  - if it stalls, malicious user is delibrately slow, it will just block communication with others

* asynchonous
- calls rely on an event / a signal / callback function
  - may call a callback function
