#+startup: overview

* synchronous / blonking approach
- current procedure is stopped until the work is complete

* Problems with only one connection at a time
- it is slow
- it is dependent on that connection to be stable
  - if it stalls, malicious user is delibrately slow, it will just block communication with others

* asynchonous
- calls rely on an event / a signal / [[id:88d921c5-1ac5-4412-a469-d75835e49158][callback function]]
  - may call a callback function

* API
