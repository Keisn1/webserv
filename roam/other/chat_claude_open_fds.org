*** This is my code and my tests so far. I want to check for any open file descriptors

You need to ensure all file descriptors are properly closed to avoid leaks. Here are the issues I see:

1. In =_listenEPoll()=, you accept connections but never close them. Add:
#+begin_src cpp
if (close(conn) == -1) {
    _logger->log("ERROR", "close: " + std::string(strerror(errno)));
    exit(1);
}
#+end_src

2. In =stop()=, you've commented out the code to close the server file descriptor. Uncomment and fix it:
#+begin_src cpp
if (close(_serverfd) == -1) {
    _logger->log("ERROR", "close: " + std::string(strerror(errno)));
    exit(1);
}
#+end_src

To test for file descriptor leaks, you could:

1. Add a counter for opened/closed descriptors
2. Use =lsof= in your tests to check for open descriptors
3. Add a =valgrind= test with =--track-fds=yes= option

The most critical fix is ensuring that each =accept()= call is paired with a corresponding =close(conn)= in your =_listenEPoll()= method.

*** I know how to solve it. But I want to write a test for it. Preferably in my unittests

Here's how to add a unit test to check for file descriptor leaks:

#+begin_src cpp
TEST_F(ServerTest, noFileDescriptorLeaks) {
    // Get initial file descriptor count
    int initialFdCount = countOpenFileDescriptors();

    // Create multiple connections
    sockaddr_in svrAddr;
    setSvrAddr(svrAddr);

    // Make several connections
    int clientPort = 8080;
    std::string clientIp = "127.0.0.1";

    // Make 10 connections
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        testOneConnection(mLogger, clientPort, clientIp, svrAddr);
        clientPort++;
    }

    // Sleep briefly to allow server to process cleanup
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));

    // Count file descriptors after test
    int finalFdCount = countOpenFileDescriptors();

    // Verify no leaks (should be same number as start)
    EXPECT_EQ(initialFdCount, finalFdCount)
        << "File descriptor leak detected: "
        << (finalFdCount - initialFdCount) << " unclosed file descriptors";
}

// Helper function to count open file descriptors for current process
int countOpenFileDescriptors() {
    int count = 0;
    std::string procPath = "/proc/self/fd";
    DIR* dir = opendir(procPath.c_str());
    if (dir != nullptr) {
        struct dirent* entry;
        while ((entry = readdir(dir)) != nullptr) {
            if (entry->d_name[0] != '.') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        closedir(dir);
    }
    return count;
}
#+end_src

Don't forget to include the necessary headers:
#+begin_src cpp
#include <dirent.h>
#+end_src

This test counts open file descriptors before and after creating multiple connections to ensure they're properly closed when done.

*** I can not have mutliple connections open on the same port, can I ?

You're right. Let me clarify:

1. Your server listens on port 8080
2. Each client connection doesn't need a specific port on the server side - the client connects /to/ port 8080
3. The client port is automatically assigned by the OS when you call =connect()=

You don't need to manually specify different client ports. Here's a corrected test:

#+begin_src cpp
TEST_F(ServerTest, noFileDescriptorLeaks) {
    // Get initial file descriptor count
    int initialFdCount = countOpenFileDescriptors();

    // Create server address
    sockaddr_in svrAddr;
    setSvrAddr(svrAddr);

    // Make several connections
    std::string clientIp = "127.0.0.1";

    // Make 10 connections sequentially
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        int clientfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
        ASSERT_GT(clientfd, 0) << "socket creation failed";

        // The client port is automatically assigned by the OS
        EXPECT_CALL(mLogger, log("INFO", testing::_));

        ASSERT_EQ(connect(clientfd, (sockaddr*)&svrAddr, sizeof(svrAddr)), 0)
            << "connect: " << strerror(errno);

        // Close client socket
        close(clientfd);

        // Sleep briefly to allow server to process
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10));
    }

    // Sleep to allow server to clean up
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));

    // Count file descriptors after test
    int finalFdCount = countOpenFileDescriptors();

    // Verify no leaks
    EXPECT_EQ(initialFdCount, finalFdCount)
        << "File descriptor leak detected: "
        << (finalFdCount - initialFdCount) << " unclosed file descriptors";
}
#+end_src

The key is that each client connects to the same server port, but the OS assigns unique source ports for each connection.

*** no it doesn't because in my testOneConnection, i delibrately assign specific ip and port for the clientSocket

You're right, I misunderstood your test setup. Looking at your =testOneConnection= function, you're actually setting a client IP and port but not in the way I initially thought.

The =clientIp= and =clientPort= in your code appear to be for logging purposes, not for binding the client socket. When you call =getClientSocket()=, it's likely creating a socket without binding it to a specific port, and when you call =connect()=, the OS assigns a random source port.

Here's a corrected file descriptor leak test that uses your existing functions:

#+begin_src cpp
TEST_F(ServerTest, noFileDescriptorLeaks) {
    // Get initial file descriptor count
    int initialFdCount = countOpenFileDescriptors();

    // Setup for connections
    sockaddr_in svrAddr;
    setSvrAddr(svrAddr);

    // Make several connections sequentially
    std::string clientIp = "127.0.0.1";
    int clientPort = 12345;  // This is just for logging in your code

    // Make 10 connections
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        testOneConnection(mLogger, clientPort, clientIp, svrAddr);
        clientPort++; // Increment just to have different logging values
    }

    // Sleep to allow server to clean up
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));

    // Count file descriptors after test
    int finalFdCount = countOpenFileDescriptors();

    // Verify no leaks
    EXPECT_EQ(initialFdCount, finalFdCount)
        << "File descriptor leak detected: "
        << (finalFdCount - initialFdCount) << " unclosed file descriptors";
}

// Helper function to count open file descriptors
int countOpenFileDescriptors() {
    int count = 0;
    DIR* dir = opendir("/proc/self/fd");
    if (dir != nullptr) {
        while (readdir(dir) != nullptr) {
            count++;
        }
        closedir(dir);
        // Adjust count to exclude ".", ".." and the dir fd itself
        count -= 3;
    }
    return count;
}
#+end_src

This test uses your existing =testOneConnection= function but focuses on checking if file descriptors are properly closed.
