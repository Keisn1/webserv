This diagram illustrates the key components of Go's HTTP server implementation:

1. *Server*: The main entry point that accepts connections and manages the lifecycle of HTTP connections.

2. *ServeMux*: The HTTP request multiplexer (router) that matches incoming requests to registered handlers based on patterns.

3. *Handler interface*: The core interface that all HTTP handlers must implement with the ServeHTTP method.

4. *ResponseWriter interface*: Used by handlers to construct HTTP responses, with extensions like Flusher and Hijacker.

5. *conn*: Represents a single client connection, which can serve multiple HTTP requests (keep-alive).

6. *response*: Implements ResponseWriter and manages the construction and sending of HTTP responses.

7. *Routing system*: Shows how the ServeMux uses a tree of routingNode objects for efficient pattern matching.

The diagram depicts how multiplexing works through the pattern-based routing system, where each request's host, method, and path components are matched against patterns to find the appropriate handler. The wildcard support in patterns provides flexibility for route definitions.

*** are you able to tell me how asynchronous I/O is achieved? I'm developing my own server in CPP, and I'm wondering how i should handle a connection after it was established, if I treat it sequentially or if I treat it in a thread. I don't know yet

**** Asynchronous I/O in Go's HTTP Server

In Go's HTTP server implementation, the approach to handling connections is based on a combination of goroutines (lightweight threads) rather than using asynchronous I/O in the traditional sense. Here's how it works:

***** Connection Handling Strategy

1. *Goroutine Per Connection*:
   - The server accepts connections in its main loop in the =Serve()= method.
   - For each new connection, it creates a dedicated goroutine by calling =go c.serve(connCtx)=.
   - This is effectively a thread-per-connection model, but goroutines are much lighter weight than OS threads.

2. *Blocking I/O with Goroutines*:
   - Go uses blocking I/O calls, but because each connection runs in its own goroutine, this doesn't block the entire server.
   - The runtime scheduler efficiently multiplexes these goroutines onto OS threads.

From the code, you can see this pattern in =Server.Serve()=:

#+begin_src go
for {
    rw, err := l.Accept()
    // Error handling omitted
    c := s.newConn(rw)
    c.setState(c.rwc, StateNew, runHooks)
    go c.serve(connCtx)  // Each connection gets its own goroutine
}
#+end_src

***** For Your C++ Server

If you're implementing a server in C++, you have several options:

1. *Thread per Connection*:
   - Simple to implement but doesn't scale well for many connections
   - Each thread consumes OS resources (stack memory, context switching overhead)
   - Similar to Go's approach but heavier weight

2. *Thread Pool*:
   - Fixed number of threads handling multiple connections
   - Better resource usage, can still use blocking I/O
   - Need to manage work distribution

3. *Asynchronous I/O*:
   - Event-driven approach using select/poll/epoll (Linux) or IOCP (Windows)
   - Single thread or small number of threads can handle many connections
   - More complex to implement but more scalable
   - C++20's coroutines can make this more ergonomic

4. *Hybrid Approach*:
   - Thread pool combined with asynchronous I/O
   - Example: One thread for accepting connections, thread pool for handling I/O

***** Recommendation

For a C++ HTTP server, I'd recommend:

1. For learning purposes or small-scale servers: Thread-per-connection or thread pool approach is simpler.

2. For production or high-scale servers: Use an event-driven asynchronous I/O model with:
   - =epoll= on Linux
   - =kqueue= on BSD/macOS
   - =IOCP= on Windows
   - Or a library like libuv, Boost.Asio, or libev that abstracts these differences

3. If using C++20, consider coroutines with an async I/O library which can give you similar ergonomics to Go's goroutines but with better performance characteristics.

The Go HTTP server can handle many connections efficiently despite its thread-per-connection model because goroutines are very lightweight (starting at ~2KB of memory). In C++, OS threads are much heavier, so a direct port of the same architecture would be less efficient.

*** what are benefits of epoll over poll?

**** Benefits of epoll over poll

When building a high-performance server in C++, choosing between =epoll= and =poll= can significantly impact performance. Here are the key benefits of =epoll= over =poll=:

***** 1. Scalability with Large Numbers of Connections

- *poll*: Performance degrades linearly with the number of file descriptors. Each call to =poll()= requires scanning the entire array of file descriptors being monitored.
- *epoll*: Scales much better with large numbers of connections. Performance remains relatively constant regardless of the number of file descriptors being monitored.

***** 2. Notification Mechanism

- *poll*: Returns all file descriptors on each call, requiring you to scan through all of them to find the ones with activity.
- *epoll*: Only returns file descriptors that actually have events, which is much more efficient when most connections are idle.

***** 3. API Design

- *poll*: Requires you to maintain and pass the entire array of file descriptors on each call.
- *epoll*: Uses a file-descriptor object that persists across calls, allowing you to set up once and then just wait for events.

***** 4. Performance Characteristics

- *poll*: O(n) complexity where n is the number of monitored file descriptors.
- *epoll*: O(1) complexity for waiting, plus O(m) for handling m active events.

***** 5. Memory Efficiency

- *poll*: Requires copying the entire file descriptor set between user space and kernel space on every call.
- *epoll*: Only transfers data about file descriptors that have activity, reducing memory bandwidth usage.

***** 6. Support for Edge-Triggered Notifications

- *poll*: Only supports level-triggered mode.
- *epoll*: Supports both level-triggered and edge-triggered modes, giving more flexibility for efficient I/O handling.

***** 7. Practical Throughput

- At small scales (less than ~100 connections), the difference may not be noticeable.
- At larger scales (1000+ connections), =epoll= can be orders of magnitude faster than =poll=.

***** 8. More Precise Control

- *epoll*: Allows for more granular control over what events to monitor per file descriptor.
- *epoll*: Allows attaching custom data to each file descriptor for faster context retrieval.

***** Real-World Example

In benchmarks with 10,000+ connections, servers using =epoll= typically show:
- Much lower CPU usage
- Lower latency for handling new events
- Higher overall throughput
- Better responsiveness under load

For a high-performance C++ server, =epoll= is strongly recommended if you're targeting Linux systems. However, keep in mind that =epoll= is Linux-specific. For cross-platform code, you may want to abstract your I/O multiplexing and use:
- =epoll= on Linux
- =kqueue= on BSD/macOS
- =IOCP= on Windows

Or consider using libraries like libuv, Boost.Asio, or libev that already provide these abstractions.
