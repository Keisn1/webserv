*** I want to write tests for my EpollIONotifier. I want to write a test, that wait returns BROKEN_CONNECTION (new e_notif) when there was an EPOLLHU event.

You'll need to add a new e_notif value for BROKEN_CONNECTION and modify the EpollIONotifier class to handle the EPOLLRDHUP event properly. Here's how you can create a test for this:

First, add BROKEN_CONNECTION to your e_notif enum in IIONotifier.h:

#+begin_src cpp
typedef enum e_notif { CLIENT_HUNG_UP, READY_TO_READ, READY_TO_WRITE, BROKEN_CONNECTION } e_notif;
#+end_src

Then modify the EpollIONotifier::wait method to map EPOLLRDHUP to the new BROKEN_CONNECTION notification:

#+begin_src cpp
int EpollIONotifier::wait(int* fds, e_notif* notifs) {
    struct epoll_event events[1]; // TODO: make maxEvents configurable
    int ready = epoll_wait(_epfd, events, 1, 10);
    if (ready > 0) {
        *fds = events[0].data.fd;
        if (events[0].events & EPOLLRDHUP)
            *notifs = BROKEN_CONNECTION;
        else if (events[0].events & EPOLLIN)
            *notifs = READY_TO_READ;
        else if (events[0].events & EPOLLOUT)
            *notifs = READY_TO_WRITE;
    } else
        *fds = -1;
    return ready;
}
#+end_src

Now, here's a test that you can add to test_IONotifier.cpp:

#+begin_src cpp
TEST(EpollIONotifierTest, DetectsBrokenConnection) {
    StubLogger logger;
    EpollIONotifier ioNotifier(logger);

    // Create a socket pair for testing
    int sockets[2];
    ASSERT_EQ(socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, sockets), 0)
        << "socketpair failed: " << strerror(errno);

    int serverSocket = sockets[0];
    int clientSocket = sockets[1];

    // Add the server socket to the notifier
    ioNotifier.add(serverSocket, READY_TO_READ);

    // Now close the client side to simulate a broken connection
    close(clientSocket);

    // Wait for the notification
    int fd;
    e_notif notification;
    int ready = ioNotifier.wait(&fd, &notification);

    // Check that we got the correct notification
    ASSERT_GT(ready, 0) << "No events detected";
    EXPECT_EQ(fd, serverSocket);
    EXPECT_EQ(notification, BROKEN_CONNECTION);

    // Clean up
    close(serverSocket);
}
#+end_src

This test:
1. Creates a pair of connected sockets using socketpair
2. Adds one socket to the epoll instance for monitoring
3. Closes the other socket to simulate a client disconnection
4. Verifies that the wait() method properly detects this as a BROKEN_CONNECTION event

Note that you might need to include additional headers:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#+end_src

This test assumes that when a socket in a socketpair is closed, the other socket will receive an EPOLLRDHUP event. You may need to adjust your approach depending on your specific platform behavior.

*** I have done that, it works. But I have a question. When I have a new connection that was accepted with =accept= and I close the clientfd, it will rather provoke an EPOLLRDHUP than a EPOLLHUP. Can you explain?

You're touching on an important distinction in how Linux socket events work. Let me explain the difference between EPOLLRDHUP and EPOLLHUP in the context of TCP connections:

*** EPOLLRDHUP vs EPOLLHUP

1. *EPOLLRDHUP* (Remote peer closed connection or shut down writing half of connection):
   - This is triggered when the remote peer (client) performs an orderly shutdown by calling =close()= or =shutdown(fd, SHUT_WR)=.
   - It indicates that the remote side has closed its write side of the connection, but you can still potentially write data to the socket.
   - This is part of the normal, graceful TCP connection termination sequence (FIN packet).

2. *EPOLLHUP* (Hang up):
   - This is a more severe condition indicating that the connection is completely broken.
   - It usually occurs in cases like:
     - Connection reset (RST packet) due to abnormal termination
     - The local socket has been closed
     - The underlying network connection was severed without proper TCP shutdown (e.g., cable unplugged, network failure)

**** Why accept()ed connections usually trigger EPOLLRDHUP:

When a client performs a normal =close()= on its socket, it initiates the TCP shutdown sequence by sending a FIN packet. This indicates "I'm done sending data." The server receives this as an EPOLLRDHUP event - a graceful closure notification.

The server can still potentially send data to the client after receiving EPOLLRDHUP, as the client might still be able to receive for a short time (half-closed connection).

EPOLLHUP tends to occur in more exceptional circumstances, like when:

- The connection fails to establish
- The connection is abnormally terminated (like with TCP RST)
- The socket is forcefully closed on the local side

**** In summary:

- EPOLLRDHUP = "The remote side closed its write channel" (graceful)
- EPOLLHUP = "The connection is completely broken" (exceptional)

For a properly designed server, handling EPOLLRDHUP is important as it represents the normal way clients disconnect. When you receive EPOLLRDHUP, you typically want to clean up the client's resources, but you might still be able to send final data if needed.

*** when the clientfd shutsdown its reading half of the connection, can i somehow recognize that server-side?


Yes, when a client shuts down its reading half of a TCP connection (using =shutdown(fd, SHUT_RD)=), it can be detected on the server side, but it's not as straightforward as detecting when the client closes its writing half.

Here's what happens and how you can detect it:

*** What happens when client calls =shutdown(fd, SHUT_RD)=

When a client calls =shutdown(fd, SHUT_RD)=:
1. The client is saying "I won't read any more data from this connection"
2. However, this is a local operation on the client side - no TCP packet is sent to the server
3. The client can still write data to the server

*** How to detect it on the server side

Since this is a client-local operation, there's no direct notification mechanism in TCP to inform the server about this. However, there are a few ways you can infer or handle this situation:

1. *Using TCP's flow control mechanism*:
   - When the client stops reading, its receive buffer will eventually fill up
   - Once the client's receive buffer is full, the TCP flow control will kick in
   - The server's =send()= or =write()= calls will start to block or return partial writes (if non-blocking)
   - You might eventually get EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK errors on non-blocking sockets

2. *Using socket error detection*:
   - If you keep sending data to a client that isn't reading, eventually TCP might determine the connection is broken
   - After enough failed retransmissions, you may receive an error like EPIPE or ECONNRESET when trying to write

3. *Using application-level heartbeats*:
   - Implement a protocol where the client must respond to periodic messages
   - If client stops responding, you can infer it may have stopped reading

For your epoll-based server, the most reliable detection would be:

#+begin_src cpp
// When writing data to a client
ssize_t sent = send(clientfd, data, dataLength, 0);
if (sent < 0) {
    if (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK) {
        // Client's receive buffer is full - might not be reading
        // Schedule this socket for EPOLLOUT to try again later
        _ioNotifier.modify(clientfd, READY_TO_WRITE);
    } else if (errno == EPIPE || errno == ECONNRESET) {
        // Connection is broken
        // Handle as if BROKEN_CONNECTION was received
    }
}
#+end_src

You could also implement a timeout mechanism:
- Track when you last received data from each client
- Periodically check if any connection has been inactive for too long
- Send heartbeat requests to ensure the client is still reading
- Close connections that don't respond within a reasonable timeframe

This is a fundamental challenge with TCP - there's no direct notification that a peer has stopped reading. The protocol only provides feedback when the network stack's buffers fill up or the connection breaks.
