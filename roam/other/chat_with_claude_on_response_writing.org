*** I'm building a server and I'm wondering about how I should do the response writing. More notably I'm asking myself:

1. Will the ResponseWriter just write to a buffer which in turn is send by the Connection ?
2. Who is responsible for sending? Is it the Connection?
3. who holds the state of what has been able to be sent? (Again, I feel that it might be the Connection. Something like _SendBuf)
4. Or should the ResponseWrite send the data and hold state of what was sent?


Looking at your code, I can offer some insights:

1. Currently, the =ResponseWriter= only writes to a string buffer (=_respString=) and doesn't do any actual network I/O. It formats the HTTP response and returns it as a string in the =write()= method.

2. The sending responsibility is handled by the =ConnectionHandler= in =_onSocketWrite()=. It creates a =ResponseWriter=, gets the formatted response, and then sends it with =send(connfd, response.c_str(), response.length(), 0)=.

3. Right now, your code doesn't track the state of what has been sent - it attempts to send the entire response in one go, which may not work for large responses.

4. For a robust server, I would recommend:
   - Keep =ResponseWriter= focused on formatting the response
   - Add send buffer management to the =Connection= class (e.g., =_sendBuf=)
   - Have =Connection= handle the actual sending and track what's been sent
   - Add support for partial sends when the socket buffer is full

This gives you clear separation of concerns:
- =ResponseWriter=: Format HTTP responses
- =Connection=: Manage connection state and handle I/O operations
- =ConnectionHandler=: Coordinate between different connections

This approach will make your server more robust for handling large responses or slow clients.

***  Then I would need to adjust the Interface of the ResponseWriter I guess.

Yes, you should adjust the IResponseWriter interface to better align with the separation of concerns. Here's what I would recommend:

#+begin_src cpp
class IResponseWriter {
  public:
    virtual ~IResponseWriter() {}
    virtual std::string write() = 0;  // Keep this for formatting the response
    // Optional: Add a method for incremental writing if needed
    virtual std::string writeHeaders() = 0;
    virtual std::string writeBody() = 0;
};
#+end_src

Then, modify the Connection class to manage the sending state:

#+begin_src cpp
class Connection {
  public:
    // Add a new state for when we're in the middle of sending
    enum STATE { ReadingHeaders, Handling, HandleBadRequest, SendResponse, PartialSend };

  private:
    // Add fields to track send state
    std::string _sendBuf;
    size_t _bytesSent;
    bool _headersSent;

  public:
    // Add methods to manage sending
    void prepareResponse();  // Format response into _sendBuf
    bool sendData();         // Try to send data, return true if complete
    bool isResponseComplete() const;
};
#+end_src

The ConnectionHandler would then use these new methods:

#+begin_src cpp
void ConnectionHandler::_onSocketWrite(int connfd) {
    Connection* conn = _connections[connfd];

    if (conn->getState() == Connection::SendResponse) {
        conn->prepareResponse();  // Format the response first time
        conn->sendData();         // Start sending
    }
    else if (conn->getState() == Connection::PartialSend) {
        if (conn->sendData()) {   // Continue sending, returns true when complete
            // Handle completion (reset state or close)
            if (conn->_response.isClosed) {
                _removeConnection(connfd);
            } else {
                conn->parseBuf();  // Look for next request
                _updateNotifier(conn);
            }
        }
    }
}
#+end_src

This approach:
1. Keeps ResponseWriter focused on formatting
2. Gives Connection responsibility for tracking send state
3. Handles partial sends properly
4. Maintains the existing interface structure while adding capabilities

*** But the responseWriter should not write the body in one go (I think your code is implying that with writeBody)

You're absolutely right. For large responses, writing the entire body at once is inefficient. Let me revise my suggestion to handle incremental body writing:

#+begin_src cpp
class IResponseWriter {
  public:
    virtual ~IResponseWriter() {}

    // Format and return just the headers
    virtual std::string writeHeaders() = 0;

    // Write a chunk of the body (offset and length control what portion)
    virtual std::string writeBodyChunk(size_t offset, size_t length) = 0;

    // Get total body size for planning
    virtual size_t getBodySize() const = 0;

    // Optional: For backward compatibility
    virtual std::string write() = 0;
};
#+end_src

Then in the Connection class:

#+begin_src cpp
class Connection {
  public:
    enum STATE { ReadingHeaders, Handling, HandleBadRequest,
                 PrepareResponse, SendingHeaders, SendingBody };

  private:
    std::string _sendBuf;
    size_t _bodyBytesSent;
    IResponseWriter* _responseWriter;

  public:
    void prepareResponse() {
        _responseWriter = new ResponseWriter(_response);
        _sendBuf = _responseWriter->writeHeaders();
        _bodyBytesSent = 0;
        _state = SendingHeaders;
    }

    bool sendData() {
        // Try to send what's in the buffer
        ssize_t sent = send(_fd, _sendBuf.c_str(), _sendBuf.length(), 0);
        if (sent > 0) {
            _sendBuf.erase(0, sent);
        }

        // If buffer is empty, proceed to next stage
        if (_sendBuf.empty()) {
            if (_state == SendingHeaders) {
                _state = SendingBody;
                // Get first chunk of body
                size_t chunkSize = std::min(static_cast<size_t>(8192),
                                           _responseWriter->getBodySize());
                _sendBuf = _responseWriter->writeBodyChunk(0, chunkSize);
                _bodyBytesSent = chunkSize;
            }
            else if (_state == SendingBody) {
                // Get next chunk if there's more
                if (_bodyBytesSent < _responseWriter->getBodySize()) {
                    size_t remaining = _responseWriter->getBodySize() - _bodyBytesSent;
                    size_t chunkSize = std::min(static_cast<size_t>(8192), remaining);
                    _sendBuf = _responseWriter->writeBodyChunk(_bodyBytesSent, chunkSize);
                    _bodyBytesSent += chunkSize;
                }
                else {
                    // We're done sending
                    delete _responseWriter;
                    _responseWriter = nullptr;
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false; // Not done sending yet
    }
};
#+end_src

This approach:
1. Separates header and body writing
2. Allows incremental reading and sending of the body
3. Efficiently manages memory by only loading chunks of the response into memory
4. Properly tracks sending state

The ResponseWriter could read directly from files for static content, avoiding loading the entire file into memory.

*** What about
#+begin_src cpp
class IResponseWriter {
  public:
    virtual ~IResponseWriter() {}
	// insteads of char* buffer, could also be std::string, std::istream
    virtual int write(char* buffer, int maxSize) = 0;
	virtual bool isDone() = 0;
};
#+end_src


That's an excellent approach! Your interface design is more flexible and efficient, focusing on a streaming model. Here's why I like it:

1. *Memory efficiency*: The writer only needs to fill a provided buffer, not create its own string or buffer.

2. *Progressive writing*: The =write()= method returns how many bytes were written, allowing callers to track progress.

3. *Completion check*: The =isDone()= method clearly indicates when all content has been written.

4. *Flexibility*: It can easily work with files, memory, or dynamic content without changing the interface.

A Connection class using this interface would look like:

#+begin_src cpp
class Connection {
public:
    enum STATE { ReadingHeaders, Handling, HandleBadRequest, SendResponse };

private:
    char _sendBuf[8192];  // Fixed buffer for sending
    int _sendBufSize;     // Current amount of valid data in the buffer
    int _sendBufPos;      // Current position in the buffer that's been sent
    IResponseWriter* _responseWriter;
    bool _isWritingResponse;

public:
    // ... existing methods ...

    bool sendData() {
        // If buffer is empty or fully sent, try to fill it again
        if (_sendBufPos >= _sendBufSize) {
            _sendBufPos = 0;
            _sendBufSize = _responseWriter->write(_sendBuf, sizeof(_sendBuf));

            // If nothing more to write, check if we're done
            if (_sendBufSize == 0) {
                if (_responseWriter->isDone()) {
                    delete _responseWriter;
                    _responseWriter = nullptr;
                    _isWritingResponse = false;
                    return true;  // Done with response
                }
            }
        }

        // Try to send what's in the buffer
        if (_sendBufSize > 0) {
            ssize_t sent = send(_fd, _sendBuf + _sendBufPos, _sendBufSize - _sendBufPos, 0);
            if (sent > 0) {
                _sendBufPos += sent;
            }
        }

        return false;  // Not done yet
    }
};
#+end_src

This design:
1. Uses a fixed memory buffer to avoid frequent allocations
2. Cleanly handles partial sends and partial buffer fills
3. Has a clear separation of responsibilities
4. Is optimized for streaming content

I think this is the best approach among the ones we've discussed!

*** but then each request would have its own ResponseWriter, I think

You're absolutely right. In your architecture, each Connection would need its own ResponseWriter instance. This is actually a good design pattern for a few reasons:

1. *Encapsulation*: Each Connection needs to manage its own response state independently.

2. *Concurrency*: Multiple connections can be processed simultaneously without sharing writers.

3. *Lifecycle management*: The ResponseWriter's lifecycle can be tied to the specific request-response cycle.

Your implementation would look something like:

#+begin_src cpp
class Connection {
private:
    // ... other member variables ...
    IResponseWriter* _responseWriter;

public:
    Connection(...) {
        // ... other initialization ...
        _responseWriter = nullptr;
    }

    ~Connection() {
        // ... other cleanup ...
        delete _responseWriter;
    }

    void prepareResponse() {
        // Create a new writer for this response
        delete _responseWriter;  // Clean up previous writer if any
        _responseWriter = new ResponseWriter(_response);
        _state = SendResponse;
    }

    bool sendData() {
        // Use the writer to fill buffer and send
        // ...

        // When done:
        if (_responseWriter->isDone()) {
            // May want to keep the writer alive until the connection is closed
            // or reset it for the next response
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
#+end_src

In the ConnectionHandler:

#+begin_src cpp
void ConnectionHandler::_onSocketWrite(int connfd) {
    Connection* conn = _connections[connfd];

    if (conn->getState() == Connection::SendResponse) {
        if (!conn->_responseWriter) {
            conn->prepareResponse();
        }

        if (conn->sendData()) {
            // Response complete
            if (conn->_response.isClosed) {
                _removeConnection(connfd);
            } else {
                conn->resetForNextRequest();
                _updateNotifier(conn);
            }
        }
    }
}
#+end_src

This approach aligns well with HTTP's request-response model, where each request gets a tailored response via its own writer instance.

*** Because the ResponseWriter needs to track, how much it already has written

Exactly! The ResponseWriter needs to maintain internal state about how much of the response has been written. This state tracking is essential for properly implementing the streaming interface.

A good implementation would look like:

#+begin_src cpp
class ResponseWriter : public IResponseWriter {
private:
    HttpResponse _resp;
    bool _headersWritten;
    size_t _bodyBytesWritten;

    // Helper methods
    bool writeHeaders(char* buffer, int maxSize, int& bytesWritten);
    bool writeBody(char* buffer, int maxSize, int& bytesWritten);

public:
    ResponseWriter(HttpResponse resp)
        : _resp(resp), _headersWritten(false), _bodyBytesWritten(0) {}

    virtual int write(char* buffer, int maxSize) override {
        int bytesWritten = 0;

        // First write headers if not already done
        if (!_headersWritten) {
            if (!writeHeaders(buffer, maxSize, bytesWritten)) {
                return bytesWritten; // Not done with headers yet
            }

            // If we've just finished headers but buffer is full, return
            if (bytesWritten >= maxSize) {
                return bytesWritten;
            }
        }

        // Write body if there's space left in buffer
        if (bytesWritten < maxSize) {
            writeBody(buffer + bytesWritten, maxSize - bytesWritten, bytesWritten);
        }

        return bytesWritten;
    }

    virtual bool isDone() override {
        return _headersWritten && (_bodyBytesWritten >= _resp.contentLength);
    }
};
#+end_src

This design:

1. Tracks both header and body writing progress
2. Handles the transition from headers to body
3. Returns how many bytes were written to the buffer
4. Provides a way to check if the entire response has been written
5. Maintains all state needed for incremental writing

Each Connection would have its own ResponseWriter instance, allowing concurrent connections to independently manage their response streaming state.
