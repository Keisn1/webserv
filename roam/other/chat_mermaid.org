*** what's a HTTP request multiplexer?

An HTTP request multiplexer, often referred to as a router, is a component in web servers or frameworks that directs incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate handler based on characteristics such as the request method (e.g., GET, POST) and the requested URL path. This allows the server to efficiently manage and respond to different types of requests by matching them to the correct endpoints or resources, simplifying the organization of code in web applications. One popular example in Go is the =http.ServeMux=, while in Node.js, frameworks like Express.js provide routing capabilities.

*** looging at server.go, can you give a mermaid diagram which illustrates the flow of a request through a fictional go server. Please give additional information


Below is an example Mermaid sequence diagram that shows how a fictional Go HTTP server might handle a request. In this diagram, the flow goes from a client connection to the listener, then a new connection is created, the request is parsed, routed through the multiplexer (e.g. ServeMux), the selected handler is invoked, and finally a response is written and sent back. Additional notes explain key transitions in the process.

Below is the Mermaid diagram:

--------------------------------------------------

#+begin_src mermaid :file ~/workspace/webserv/mermaid.svg
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant L as Listener (net.Listener)
    participant S as Server
    participant Conn as Connection (conn)
    participant RP as Request Parser (readRequest)
    participant Mux as Multiplexer (ServeMux)
    participant H as Handler
    participant RW as Response Writer (ResponseWriter)
    participant R as Response Finalizer (finishRequest)

    C->>L: Open TCP connection & send HTTP request
    L->>S: Accept connection
    S->>Conn: newConn() creates a connection instance
    Conn->>RP: Read & parse HTTP request\n(readRequest, cleanPath, validations)
    RP-->>Conn: Return Request struct
    Conn->>S: Updates connection state to Active
    S->>Mux: Routes Request (matches host, method, path)
    Mux->>H: Selects appropriate Handler based on pattern
    H->>RW: Process request (e.g., business logic, template rendering)
    RW->>Conn: Writes response headers/body\n(via buffered writer & chunking)
    Conn->>R: finishRequest() flushes buffers & cleans up
    R-->>C: HTTP response sent back over TCP
    Note right of S: If connection is keep-alive, the connection may be reused\nfor subsequent requests.

--------------------------------------------------

Additional Information:
• The listener (net.Listener) accepts a new TCP connection.
• The Server builds a new conn (connection) object which sets the internal state.
• The request is read by readRequest which validates headers and ensures the path is clean.
• The multiplexer (for example, http.ServeMux) matches the URL path and method to one of the registered patterns.
• The chosen handler is called; it writes its response via the ResponseWriter.
• The buffered response (possibly using chunkWriter) is flushed in finishRequest, and the response is sent back to the client.
• Optionally, if keep-alives are enabled, the connection stays open for further requests.

This diagram abstracts many details but captures the main flow through a fictional Go HTTP server kernel.
