*** I have a nice setup of my server right now, where I decapsulate the listener from the server. I know that there is probably going to be an HttpParser, a ConnectionHandler, a CGI, Mapper and a Reponsewriter. I have trouble envisioning right now, how I would integrate this in my existing code, so that responsibilities are clearly seperated and I could work on these things seperately. 

Looking at your code, you've established a good separation of concerns with interfaces like =ILogger= and =IListener=. To extend this for the HTTP server components, you can follow the same pattern.

Here's how you could integrate the new components:

1. *Create interfaces for the new components*:
   - =IHttpParser=
   - =IConnectionHandler=
   - =ICgi=
   - =IMapper=
   - =IResponseWriter=

2. *Extend the Listener class*:
   - Currently, your Listener accepts a connection, logs it, and closes it
   - Modify it to delegate to a ConnectionHandler instead of immediately closing

3. *Request processing flow*:
#+begin_src
Listener → ConnectionHandler → HttpParser → Mapper → (CGI if needed) → ResponseWriter → ConnectionHandler
#+end_src

4. *Implementation example*:

#+begin_src cpp
// In ConnectionHandler.h
class ConnectionHandler : public IConnectionHandler {
private:
    ILogger* _logger;
    IHttpParser* _parser;
    IMapper* _mapper;
    ICgi* _cgi;
    IResponseWriter* _writer;

public:
    ConnectionHandler(ILogger*, IHttpParser*, IMapper*, ICgi*, IResponseWriter*);
    void handleConnection(int clientSocket, struct sockaddr_in clientAddr);
};
#+end_src

#+begin_src cpp
// In Listener.cpp (modified)
void Listener::listen() {
    // ...existing code...

    conn = accept(portfd, (struct sockaddr*)&theirAddr, (socklen_t*)&addrlen);

    // Instead of closing right away:
    _connectionHandler->handleConnection(conn, theirAddr);

    // The ConnectionHandler would be responsible for closing when done
}
#+end_src

5. *Dependency Injection*:
   - Inject these components through constructors like you did with the logger
   - Create a factory class to build all these components if needed

This approach lets you:
- Develop each component independently with clear responsibilities
- Test components in isolation
- Swap implementations easily (e.g., different HTTP parsers)
- Add new functionality without disrupting existing code

Your current architecture already follows good principles, so these additions should integrate well with minimal changes to your existing code.

*** so i would basically have the ConnectionHandler execute the pipeline

Yes, exactly! The ConnectionHandler would orchestrate the entire request-response pipeline. This design has several advantages:

1. *Orchestration*: ConnectionHandler becomes the coordinator that owns the execution flow, ensuring each component performs its specific task in sequence.

2. *Clear Responsibility Boundaries*:
   - Listener: Just accepts connections
   - ConnectionHandler: Orchestrates the request processing
   - HttpParser: Parses the HTTP request
   - Mapper: Routes the request to the correct handler
   - CGI: Processes dynamic content if needed
   - ResponseWriter: Formats and sends the HTTP response

3. *Simplified Implementation Example*:

#+begin_src cpp
void ConnectionHandler::handleConnection(int clientSocket, struct sockaddr_in clientAddr) {
    // Log the connection
    logConnection(_logger, clientAddr);

    // Read and parse the HTTP request
    std::string requestData = readFromSocket(clientSocket);
    HttpRequest request = _parser->parse(requestData);

    // Find the appropriate handler for the request
    RouteInfo route = _mapper->getRoute(request);

    // Process the request (static file or CGI)
    HttpResponse response;
    if (route.isCgi) {
        response = _cgi->execute(request, route);
    } else {
        response = handleStaticFile(request, route);
    }

    // Write response back to client
    _writer->writeResponse(clientSocket, response);

    // Close connection (or keep alive based on HTTP headers)
    close(clientSocket);
}
#+end_src

4. *Extensibility*:
   - You can easily add middleware concepts by expanding the pipeline
   - Support HTTP/1.1 features like persistent connections by modifying the ConnectionHandler
   - Add error handling at each step

You're on the right track in recognizing that this pipeline approach gives you good separation of concerns while keeping the overall flow manageable. Each component can be developed, tested, and even replaced independently as long as it adheres to its interface.
