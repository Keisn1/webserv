- a reverse proxy server is a server that in a client-server model is located at the server side before the server which provides the actual service to the client
  - it is often used to do validation on the client request, add information, redirect to specific servers (load-balancing), caching (Redis), logging and [[id:2d2bf457-b078-469b-b953-d811aa3417d9][SSL-termination]]
