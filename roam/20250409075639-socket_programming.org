* what is a socket
- a socket is a concept generally referred two if two parties want to exchange data in two directions
- besides sockets which allow parties to communicate over a computer network, there are also sockets which facilitate the communication between processes inside the same computer ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket][UDS - UNIX domain sockets]])
- for network communication, we usually speak about Berkeley sockets
  - man 2 socket =<sys/socket.h>= =socket()=
  - this library function is part of POSIX and came out of =BSD= (Berkeley Software Distribution - Berkeley Socket)

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, 4.4BSD.
       socket() appeared in 4.2BSD.  It is generally portable to/from non-BSD systems supporting clones of the BSD socket layer (including System V variants).

* API
** htons
- *Why `htons()` is needed*:
  - standardizing *Network byte order*
    - Different computer architectures (x86, ARM, etc.) may store multi-byte data like port numbers in different ways
    - ensures that all machines interpret the data correctly, no matter their architecture.
    - So, you use `htons()` to ensure that the port number is properly formatted for network transmission
