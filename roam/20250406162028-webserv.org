#+startup: overview

- allowed functions that I don't know
  - gai_strerror
  - socketpair
  - socket, accept, listen, send, recv
  - bind
  - setsockopt, getsockname
  - getprotobyname
  - htons, htonl, ntohs, ntohl
  - select, poll, epoll (epoll_create, epoll_ctl, epoll_wait)
  - kqueue (kqueue, kevent)
- apparently poll, secect, keque, epoll do the somewhat same thing

- We shall read the RFC and perform tests with telnet and NGINX before starting the project

- don't attempt to use read/recv or write/send on any file descriptor without using poll => grade 0
  - this comes with performance issues

- always compare your programs behaviour to the behaviour of nginx in case of any doubt
- the small tester can help in finding and fixing bugs
- I can write tests in golang
