#+title: Notes Kay

- [ ] change throwing of std::runtime_error to something that makes sense
- [X] have a complete Equal check function of ServerConfig

- [X] all of the tests probably fit into maximum of 2 tests (those which throw error and those where you test for equalness)
- [X] the same for test_config_ast.cpp and test_config_events.cpp

- [X] Naming
  - [X] test_Router.cpp (not test_http_routing)

  - [X] ValidationRules sounds like a struct but not like a class
    - [X] what is it supposed to do (why is it not requestValidator?)

- [X] why is there a buildAST function in the tests (why is getAst public in the parser? If nobody is supposed to use it?)

- [X] the CommonConfig constructor is needless

- [X] why does the router match return the host (which is actually part of the request)?

- [X] the Router is not concerned with which port the request came from. Somebody is responsible of choosing the right Router for the port

- [ ] restrict config allowedMethods to GET, POST, DELETE
- [ ] no error is thrown when there is no ";"
  #+begin_src conf
index       index.html index.htm
  #+end_src
- [ ] oneMB as default if clientMaxBody is not set
