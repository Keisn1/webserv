#+title: Notes Kay

- [X] have a complete Equal check function of ServerConfig
- [X] all of the tests probably fit into maximum of 2 tests (those which throw error and those where you test for equalness)
- [X] the same for test_config_ast.cpp and test_config_events.cpp
- [X] Naming
  - [X] test_Router.cpp (not test_http_routing)
  - [X] ValidationRules sounds like a struct but not like a class
    - [X] what is it supposed to do (why is it not requestValidator?)
- [X] why is there a buildAST function in the tests (why is getAst public in the parser? If nobody is supposed to use it?)
- [X] the CommonConfig constructor is needless
- [X] why does the router match return the host (which is actually part of the request)?
- [X] the Router is not concerned with which port the request came from. Somebody is responsible of choosing the right Router for the port
* TODO
- [X] change throwing of std::runtime_error to something that makes sense
- [X] no error is thrown when there is no ";" in
  #+begin_src conf
index       index.html index.htm
  #+end_src
- [X] cgi - only on location level
- [X] oneMB as default if clientMaxBody is not set
- [X] talk to Eric about oneMB const
- [X] restrict config allowedMethods to GET, POST, DELETE
- [X] insert Routing
- [X] make reset public on HttpParser
- [X] test for requests with longer bodies
  - [X] test for long responses where sent needs to happen more than once
  - [X] make the read and send methods adjustable in buffer size
  - [X] rename to _headersBuf and _bodyBuf
** listener
- [ ] implement TimeoutMechanism (stale connections, connections that are kept open after receiving a response)
- [ ] ioNotifier.wait fills up multiples descriptors and notifications
** ResponseWriter
- [ ] responseWrite needs to fill out necessary headers
- [ ] it's the reason why some clients don't close the connection
** connection Handling (architecture)
- [X] normalization of uri needs to be done before routing
- [ ] epolll doesn
- [ ] add a test that really uploads a file
  - [ ] make sure that all the file descriptors are closed
    - [ ] also a test for a broken connection and then the file should be closed
  - [ ] add tests for normal UploadHandler to close the files after successful upload
- [ ] implement more than one router
  - [ ] also handle cases where the routing is failing
- [ ] handle ClientHungUp
  - [ ] BrokenConnection just removes the connection
  - [ ] check how ClientHungUp affects the behavior
  - [ ] check out this comment that you wrote [[file:tests/unittests/test_ConnHdlrTestWithIntegerAsParameter.cpp::// TODO: if we were to detach the thread just after launching it, the clientfd might be closed (Teardown) before we]]
- [X] probably change IHandler handle interface (add ConnectionInfo to it)
** Uploadhandler
1. [X] don't upload to same file simultaneously
2. [X] don't remove file (test for broken connection basically)
3. [X] only reply with a response once!
4. [ ] test for overlapping uploadBody and headers of following request
