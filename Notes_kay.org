#+title: Notes Kay

- [ ] change throwing of std::runtime_error to something that makes sense
- [ ] have a complete Equal check function of ServerConfig
- [ ] all of the tests probably fit into maximum 2 tests (those who throw error and those where you test for equalness)
- [ ] the same for test_config_ast.cpp and test_config_events.cpp
- [ ] Naming
  - [ ] test_Router.cpp (not test_http_routing)
  - [ ] ValidationRules sounds like a struct but not like a class
    - [ ] what is it supposed to do (why is it not requestValidator?)
- [ ] why is there a buildAST function in the tests (why is getAst public in the parser? If nobody is supposed to use it?)
- [ ] the CommonConfig constructor is needless
- [ ] why does the router match return the host (which is actually part of the request)?
- [ ] the Router is not concerned with which port the request came from. Somebody is responsible of choosing the right Router for the right port
